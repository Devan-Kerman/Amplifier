# Amplifier
A 'external driver' based architecture to enhance/compliment LLMs to enable deep reasoning and logic, in addition to
increasing explainability, and steerability.

Purpose
---
The purpose of this project is to explore the potential for incremental problem-solving in LLMs through more rigidly
defined reasoning loops.

Implementation
