# Amplifier

---
A engine to enhance/compliment LLMs to enable deep reasoning/logic, explainability, and steerability.
The purpose of this project is to explore the potential for incremental problem-solving in LLMs through more rigidly
defined reasoning loops.

### Deep Reasoning
The way complex reasoning functions in humans is extremely complex. In the human brain, neurons are organized in a graph-like
structure within organelles and brain structures which themselves are organized as a graph. In order to truly emulate the
full span of this complex system, we would need computers that can activate millions or billions of neurons at a time. 
Unlike the human brain which is only limited by blood flow and blood sugar level, computers can't activate billions neurons
over and over again in millisecond time frames.

Additionally, the structure and layout of these neurons in the human brain is unimaginably complex, and there are few structures
that are completely isolated/independent of each other. **This makes it incredibly difficult to describe *human* reasoning 
as a set of discrete processes, as in reality every process interacts with each other in complex ways.**

The goal of this project is to create complex reasoning in AI, to do this I believe the best approach is to find an *unique* 
set of discrete processes that is capable of complex reasoning. This has the advantage of being a tackle-able problem,
and it would be easier to monitor and debug unlike a gigantic neural network.

### The Loop

I have such a process described in my notes but they're a bit scattered right now so
